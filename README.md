 The main task of this project was to develop a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. As my favorite place to visit I chose London and  created a list of places like museums, towers, bridges. 🌉 🗼 🏣 
 The app allows you to search for places, filter the list down when you type. It displays the locations on the map. There are markers where you can click and get an info about that place on Wikipedia. The app is responsive, which means it resizes when you use any device with different screen size. 💻  📱
Then to add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.
